### Interests

As someone who has been in the scientific field for my whole life, I think that we as scientists need to start doing a better job communicating to audiences outside of the scientific field. In my degree program, I'm focusing in communications to tackle this exact problem. I love working with data and making it into a story so that people can understand why it matters to them and the places they care about.

### Experience


I've spent the past two years working with data and am comfortable with R. Over the summer I help a fellowship as a park of the Scientists in the Parks program for Yellowstone National Park. See this video to learn a little about what I did.
