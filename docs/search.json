In my degree program, I’m focusing in communications to tackle this exact problem. I love working with data and making it into a story so that people can understand why it matters to them and the places they care about.\r\nExperience\r\nI’ve spent the past two years working with data and am comfortable with R. Over the summer I help a fellowship as a park of the Scientists in the Parks program for Yellowstone National Park. See this video to learn a little about what I did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
